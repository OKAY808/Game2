How to play:
You and your friend will take turns placing yourself to adjacent squares 
on a field(the size of the playable area is predetermined by You, the player),
by clicking with the left mouse button on the desired square on the field
(the square is valid only if no one has been there already). The winner is the one with the most points. 
The game ends when one of the player doesn't have a valid square to move to.

How the game will proceed:
Once you click Play you will see a window where you can chose if you want to play alone(with a bot)
or with a friend, after selecting You will see the game option screen where you will be able to 
choose the size of the field by entering the height and width of the field, the minimum size of the 
field is 4x4 and maximum is 15x9, there will also be an option to decide how many rounds will be played in the current 
session(keep in mind that you can only enter odd numbers). After that the game starts by placing you and the 
other player on oppsite corners of the board.In the end the winner will be displayed 
and you will have the option of returning to the main menu to start over.
